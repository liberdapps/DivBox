    // 0.0075 ether (0.75% x 1 ether) will be distributed equally among these 5 x 10^8 shares existing shares, i.e.,
    // 0.000000000015 ether per share.
    // 
    // A similar logic takes place when someone sells shares: if there are currently 100 x 10^8 shares and 25 x 10^8 shares
    // are sold for 2 ethers, 0.015 ether (0.75% x 2 ethers) will be distributed equally among the remaining 75 x 10^8 shares,
    // i.e., 0.000000000002 ether per share.
    //
    // Consider the case where the contract has 10^14 shares (at least 20K ether invested in it). If someone buys 0.01 ether
    // worth of shares, the contract will try to distribute 0.000075 ether (0.75% x 0.01 ether) as dividends among those 10^14 
    // shares, but dividing 0.000075 ether (or 75 x 10^12 wei) into 10^14 shares would result in 0.75 wei. Since we can only do 
    // integer divisions, 75 x 10^12 wei divided by 10^14 shares would result in 0 wei, with a reminder of 75 x 10^12 wei. So, 
    // in this scenario, the amount of 0.000075 ether wouldn't be actually distributed among the shareholders.
    //
    // So, to avoid too much loss of precision, we'll scale up dividend amounts so that we can properly distribute them even
    // when they're too small compared to the current number of shares. Considering MAX_SHARES (10^16), a scaling factor of
    // 10^8 allow us to properly distribute as little as 0.0000000001 ether as dividends among those shares. So, in the example
    // above, 0.000075 ether would be represented as 7500 scaled ether which could be fully divided by 10^14 shares, resulting
    // in 0.00000000075 scaled ether per share (with 0 as remainder).
    //
    // When withdrawing the actual dividends, we'll unscale dividend amounts, i.e., 0.00000000075 scaled ether per share would
    // be equivalent of 0.0000000000000000075 ether per share, or 7.5 wei per share. Since that the smallest dividend amount that
    // we can support is 1 wei, if some user has 7.5 wei per share to withdraw, only 7 wei per share would be immediately

    // to calculate and distribute those dividends, we don't want to ever run into overflow/underflow errors that could prevent
    // people from acessing their dividends. The simplest way to assure that is by applying good limits.
    //
    // With MAX_SHARES = 10^16, we can assure that we can have up to 10^61 scaled dividends per share without running into
